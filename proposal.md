Project Description - 
	The project will be a drawing board application that will allow multiple users to sketch on a drawing board at the same time. The project will allow a person (or host) to create a room with a given Room ID where other users can also join his room using that ID to connect to the room. Then, the users will all be able to draw on the screen together, weather it is to make a small doodle on screen, share ideas, or provide homework help (kind of like a interactive Khan Academy), user can use the shared drawing canvas board to work together to design new ideas.

Project Design - 
The project will utilize javascript, css, html5, and jQuery in order to help create the drawing canvas for people to use on a web browser. The project will also utilized AJAX as a tool in order to track each personâ€™s stokes and update each person's screen when a change has been made.  The project will also incorporate a SQL database in order to keep account information, account login, and player history.

Use Case - 
User will register an account with the SQL database.
User will login into the website using registered accounts.
User will create a room (or lobby) to begin drawing.
User will click on the screen to draw on the screen.
User can join rooms using a Room ID provide by a host.
Users can save and share drawings they have created.

Project Schedule -
-Checkpoint 1
Create Drawing Canvas and Basic Functionalities
-Checkpoint 2
Incorporate Multi-User Functionalities
-Checkpoint 3
Create Account Server
Create User Registration
-Checkpoint 4
Incorporate Better UI
Add More Functionalities To Drawing Tools

Project Justification
Novelty- 
-This project is different because the idea is different. Having people collaboratively work together to draw on the screen will allow the users to share ideas in a visual context making sharing ideas and thoughts a lot more efficient then just verbal communication. Being able to portray you ideas with your peers and having them provide visual feedback in real-time will prove to be very useful in business practices, classroom use, and creative use. 

Complexity - 
-This project would be a good showcase of my abilities because it would show the use of integrating different libraries together to create a project. Using tools like javascript, jQuery, and AJAX will demonstrated some of the tools that I have learned in class during my time taking IST 411. It will also demonstrate persistent data using the showcase feature and also handling multiple users at the same time. This project would also incorporate the use of a SQL database for user registration and user data.
